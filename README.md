# Workshop: AI-Driven Image Recognition Techniques

Welcome to the repository for the **AI-Driven Image Recognition Techniques** workshop of the REDUCE project: Reducing Bycatch of Threatened Megafauna in the East Central Atlantic.

This three-day hands-on workshop, held from May 5 to 7, 2025, at the University of Barcelona (Spain), was designed to cover AI-driven image recognition techniques that can be used for marine species identification.

## üìå Workshop Objectives

- Introduce core AI-driven image recognition techniques, from classic to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.  
- Provide hands-on experience in implementing and fine-tuning deep-learning models for species identification.  
- Discuss recent breakthroughs in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based vision architectures.  
- Explore real-world applications in fisheries monitoring and bycatch mitigation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

You can run the practical component of the workshop both locally and on Google Colab.

### 1. Run Locally (Python 3.11)

In an environment running Python 3.11 and capable of opening Jupyter Notebooks, install the project dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Afterward, open the provided `.ipynb` file and run all cells.

> **Tip:** A GPU-enabled environment (CUDA-capable) will speed up training, but is optional.

### 2. Google Colab (Zero-Install)

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Press **File ‚Üí Upload notebook** and select the provided `.ipynb` file.
3. Upload the `images` folder and the `model_params.pt` file to the Colab "Files" pane.
4. Press **Runtime ‚Üí Run all**.

**Colab already includes the required libraries, so no extra installation is needed.**

> **Tip:** Selecting the T4 GPU-enabled runtime will speed up training, but is optional.
